This fixes implement the possibility of performing a fluctuating charges MD
simulation in the framework of F-RESP technique developed by the group of
Prof. L. Guidoni at L'Aquila University (Italy).
In this technique, atom charges are linear combinations of electric field
exercised along the bonds of the molecule they belong to by all the atoms
in the system. Used electric field is called "fictitious" because it is not
produced by the charges the system has at the current timestep but by
fixed "generating charges", that are parameters of the force field.
This avoids the need of a self-consistent calculation or a Lagrangian approach
that are common in other polarizable force fields, making simulations very fast.
Electric field that influences charge value can be calculated in two ways:
in the first case, Ewald summation technique is employed while, in the second,
the relatively recent Fennell's modification of Wolf summation (aka DSF)
technique by Fennell and Gezelter (2006).

An article describing accurately this technique is about to be submitted.

See the doc page of these fixes for an explanation of the use of the command.

Input examples can be found in examples/USER-FRESP.
