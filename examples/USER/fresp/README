In "fresp_types.dat", the row following #ntypes expresses the number of F-RESP atom types.
In the shown case, they are 3 because the two hydrogen atoms of water are considered, 
for the sake of generality, to have different types.
The rows after #atypes express the mapping between atomic indexes (those present in Lammps 
data file) and F-RESP types.

In "polarparm.dat", the rows following #q0 express the mapping between F-RESP types 
(that start from 0) and their q0 charges.
The rows following #qgen express the mapping between F-RESP types and their qgen charges.
Each rows following #k_Efield contain, as first entry, the F-RESP type of one extreme of 
the considered bond, as second entry, the F-RESP type of the other extreme of the bond, 
as third entry, the F-RESP type of the atom whose charge is influenced by the fictitious 
electric field along that bond and eventually, as last entry, the coefficient that 
correlates the fictitious electric field along the bond with the charge variation.
The meaning of the entries in the rows following #k_bond are the same except that, 
in this case, the last entry expresses the coefficient correlating the stretching of 
the bond from its natural value with the charge variation.
In the shown case, coefficients from #k_Efield are those we found for TIP3P water 
(expressed in LAMMPS electron units); coefficients from #k_bond are 0 because, also if 
we implemented this feature, we only tried F-RESP on TIP3P water, in which bonds are rigid.

For the couples of bonds and atoms (expressed in F-RESP types) for which no coefficient 
has been specified, 0 is assumed.
